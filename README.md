We are currently considering a second run. If you would like one please leave your email in the survey: https://t.co/keoxwR8fyg  

We went to DEF CON 26 and launched an unofficial DEF CON badge. We wanted to be able to create something different and unique to some of the other designs out there. The badge is controlled by an STM32 that drives the servo and dual 16 segment LEDS on the front. We attached a 3d printed arm to the servo. All the files are source code are Open Source and in this repo. You are welcome to make one yourself via OSHpark or JLC PCB. Gerber files are located in the repo.
